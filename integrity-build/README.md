This is a Go program designed to perform file integrity checking and encryption on specific directories.

1. **Purpose**: 
- Creates a system to ensure file integrity by generating and storing file hashes
- Encrypts the hash database and hides the encryption key in an image using steganography
- Uses a flag file to prevent multiple runs

2. **Key Components**:
- File Hashing: Uses SHA-256 to create file hashes
- Encryption: Implements AES-GCM encryption
- Steganography: Uses the `steghide` tool to hide encryption keys in images
- Filesystem: Handles mounting/unmounting of /sda1 partition

3. **Main Workflow**:
```go
1. Checks for existing flag file (/data/.flag)
2. Remounts /sda1 as read-write
3. Generates random 32-byte key
4. Hides key in provided image
5. For each specified directory:
   - Scans files and calculates hashes
   - Saves hashes to .db.json
   - Encrypts .db.json with the key
6. Creates flag file
7. Remounts /sda1 as read-only
```

4. **Security Features**:
- AES-GCM encryption for hash database
- Random nonce generation
- Key hidden via steganography
- Read-only filesystem protection

5. **Potential Improvements**:
- Error handling could be more robust
- Add verification step for extracted key
- Include backup mechanism for .db.json files
- Add logging functionality
- Consider using a config file instead of hardcoded directories

6. **Dependencies**:
- Requires `steghide` installed on the system
- Needs appropriate permissions for /sda1 mounting
- Must have write access to specified directories
